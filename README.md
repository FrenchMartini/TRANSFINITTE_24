# **Decentralized Patent Registry DApp**

## **Project Overview**
The Decentralized Patent Registry DApp is a blockchain-based platform for registering, managing, and transferring ownership of patents. This decentralized solution ensures transparency, immutability, and verifiable ownership, offering a secure way to protect intellectual property on a public blockchain. 

The project leverages Etherium (or compatible EVM networks) for smart contracts and enables patent owners to register their inventions, transfer ownership, and verify patent details without relying on centralized authorities.We use **Etherlink** to deploy it on the EVM network.

## **Features**
**These features are available on our dapp**
- **Patent Registration**: Users can register a patent by providing its title, description, and associating it with their blockchain wallet address.
- **Ownership Transfer**: The DApp allows patent owners to transfer ownership of patents to another address securely.
- **Patent Lookup**: Anyone can query patent details like title, description, and current owner.
- **Decentralization**: Powered by Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible blockchain), this DApp eliminates the need for intermediaries or centralized control.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Kotlin**: Used for implementing the frontend of the dapp.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts written in Solidity to handle patent registration, transfers, and lookups.
- **Ethereum (or Sepolia Testnet)**: Deployed on an EVM-compatible network.
- **Web3.js**: Interact with the smart contract through a Node.js backend.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend API for handling user inputs and communicating with the blockchain.
- **Remix IDE**: Used for contract deployment and testing.
- **Infura**: Blockchain node provider for interacting with the Ethereum network.

## **Smart Contract Details**
The `PatentRegistry` smart contract allows users to:
1. **Register a Patent**: Users provide a title and description, and the contract stores it with their address as the owner.
2. **Transfer Ownership**: The current patent owner can transfer the patent to another Ethereum address.
3. **Query Patent Details**: Anyone can check the title, description, and owner of a registered patent.
4. **Renew Patent**: Since every patent lasts for a certain duration we want to implement a feature where a user will be able to renew their patent through the app
5. **Search Patent**: This will enable users to search for patents with the id.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** installed
- **NPM** or **Yarn** package manager
- **Ethereum wallet** (e.g., MetaMask or a Tezos wallet for testing purposes)
- **Infura** account for accessing the Ethereum blockchain.

### **Smart Contract Deployment**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile and deploy the contract using **Remix IDE** or **Hardhat** (if using Hardhat):

3. Update the environment variables in your `.env` file with the contract address and Infura API URL.

### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   INFURA_API_URL=<Your Infura API URL>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Deployed Contract Address>
   ```

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **API Endpoints**
- **Register a Patent**: `POST /register`
  - **Body**: `{"title": "Patent Title", "description": "Patent Description", "userAddress": "0xYourAddress"}`
- **Transfer Patent**: `POST /transfer`
  - **Body**: `{"patentId": 1, "fromAddress": "0xYourAddress", "toAddress": "0xRecipientAddress"}`

## **Testing the Smart Contract**
- Use **Remix IDE** to deploy and interact with the smart contract on the testnet.
- For API testing, use **Postman** to send requests to the backend server.

## **Future Improvements**
- New criteras for better searching in the app.
- Provide record of patent whcih dipslays the disputes which occured, this again supports the idea of degeneracy and transparency.
- Exploring IPFS for decentralized patent storage.
